   	This plugin transforms a Json Payload to a PDF via XHTML/CSS based on the provided
    Velocity templates. The transformed formats will then be stored as Payloads.
  	The transformer utilises <a href='http://code.google.com/p/flying-saucer/'/>Flying saucer and IText</a> to transform the XHTML into PDF.
